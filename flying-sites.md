Currently the only flying field the club normally operates out of is Mississippi State University's RR Foil Plant Science Research Center aka "North Farm."

We are currently working on a solution to allow club members access through the gate. Until then, if the gate is closed then park outside the gate, or proceed down to the Rose Garden to see if that gate is open.

## North Farm Field Rules
### Preface
The heart of an RC club is its flying site – where we can all meet at the end of a long day or week, pull out our various craft, shoot the breeze about the newest transmitter, and cruise through the sky with our friends. On that note, it is **vitally** important that we conduct ourselves with safety, integrity, and decorum out at our flying sites. We do not own this land, and we are extremely fortunate that Mississippi State University is willing to allow us to fly at no cost over state property.
Any violations of the following rules will result in swift punishment, up to and including expulsion from the club or being banned from this flying site indefinitely. A mistake on our part that causes any harm to any university personnel or bystanders is likely to result in the banishment of all recreational flights from university land, so we must police ourselves accordingly. If you see a fellow club member about to break one of these rules, please say something to them, and if they do not listen then file a grievance report to the club safety officer.

### Rules
**1. Review, understand, and comply with [MSU Operating Policy 79.11](https://www.policies.msstate.edu/sites/www.policies.msstate.edu/files/7911.pdf)’s recreational flight guidelines**  
Namely, understand that you must be approved as an individual to fly, and you must give 24 hours' notice to the RFRL Aviation Safety Officer. At present that is best done by emailing <msuuas@msstate.edu> with your expected times of operation.  

**2. Follow all [AMA Safety Code](https://www.modelaircraft.org/system/files/documents/105.pdf) rules**  
Pay close attention to the rule of **not overflying people, structures, or vehicles,** if there are MSU North Farm personnel working in the field in front of you, then you must not overfly them. Even if they are not MSU affiliated (many people walk or jog at North Farm), they have a right to enjoyment of the property too and you may not overfly them.

**3. Always give right-of-way to MSU personnel**  
This is their land, their property, and their priority first. If there is a drone flight being conducted by MSU, then it is your responsibility to understand what their plan is and ensure that you do not interfere. If you cannot establish contact or ensure that your flying can safely coexist with theirs, then **do not fly**.

**4. Do not leave the boundaries of North Farm**  
We are only authorized to fly within its confines, and leaving it causes a safety and liability risk.
