Presently the club has one regular flying site that has special permissions for getting flying access.
In order to protect the landowners, we are not publically disclosing the site online, but will provide information if contacted.
Magnolia State Aviators will help facilitate the process of getting access for club members, and will provide strict field rules to ensure that access is not threatened.
