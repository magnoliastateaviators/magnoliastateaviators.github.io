The Magnolia State Aviators are an Academy of Model Aeronautics club local to the Starkville, MS area. We have a wide range of fliers, from park electrics, to big gassers, along with a few sailplane enthusiasts. We would love to see you out at the flying field to join us in the near future!

We hold meetings and events, take a look at our [calendar](/calendar) for more info.

We also have an active [Discord](https://discord.gg/W3d8xkCrnP), stop on by and say hello!

If you would like to donate or pay club dues, please contact the president on either Discord or via the email address at the bottom of the page.
