The Magnolia State Aviators are an Academy of Model Aeronautics club local to the Starkville, MS area. We have a wide range of fliers, from park electrics, to big gassers, along with a few sailplane enthusiasts. We would love to see you out at the flying field to join us in the near future!

We hold meetings and events, take a look at our [calendar](/calendar) for more info.

We also have an active [Discord](https://discord.gg/W3d8xkCrnP), stop on by and say hello!
